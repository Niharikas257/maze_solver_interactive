## ðŸš€ Overview
**Maze Solver** is a Python project that generates mazes and finds a path between a start and an exit point using **graph traversal algorithms**.  
It supports both **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for finding the **shortest path** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** for **backtracking exploration**.

You can run it in two modes:
- **Interactive mode** â€“ the program asks for grid size, entry/exit, wall density, etc.  
- **Command-line mode** â€“ provide arguments (`--rows`, `--cols`, etc.) for automation and testing.

This project is perfect for showcasing **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** knowledge, particularly graphs, queues, recursion, and backtracking.

## âœ¨ Features
- Generate **random mazes** with configurable wall density.  
- Solve mazes using:
  - **BFS** â€“ always finds the shortest path.  
  - **DFS** â€“ explores deeply and backtracks.  
- Optionally **ensure solvable mazes** by regenerating until a valid path exists.  
- Support for **visited overlay** (`Â·`) and **path overlay** (`*`).  
- Export generated mazes to `.txt` files for reuse.  
- Run in **interactive mode** (prompts) or **CLI mode** (arguments).
